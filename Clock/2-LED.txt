VIRTUAL DIGITAL CLOCK - LED Mode

NOTE: if the LED version of the clock looks weird in PuTTy on Windows,
      go to the menu and choose 'Change Settings'.  Then you want
      Window->Translation->Remote Character Set, and choose 'DEC-MCS'.

      For other weirdnesses, see:

What You Should Do Before You Start:

1) Read 'LED-layout.txt' and figure out on paper which bits make
   which numbers.  (Making sketches really does help.)


What Remains To Be Done To The Code:

** Be sure your AM/PM and offset code are correct before continuing! **

2) The View needs to put the correct bits into the location pointed
   at by 'where', with the appropriate offsets, so that digits show
   up displaying the time.  (You'll need the sketches you made in
   Step 1.)

   Right now, it puts in some bits, but they're all wrong.


3) You should do something with the colons, whether they blink or
   just stay on all the time or whatever.  ALSO, set the AM/PM/24H
   indicator correctly.

   **  NOTE ABOUT COLONS: sometimes, the dots that make the colons
   **  appear to 'smear' across the display.  This is usually because
   **  your shell's TERM variable is set to 'xterm' instead of 'putty'.

4) Use the function 'set_title_bar()' to put in the names of the
   people in your group at the top of your clock.

   The function copies 81 characters out of an array to another
   memory location, and then copies the first 78 to the top line of
   the screen.  (Remember C strings are terminated by null characters.)
   If the string contains a '-', then it shows as part of the frame.

   You should declare a character array and space it out enough so that
   it looks vaguely centered.  Then your main() function should call
   'set_title_bar()' with that array as an argument.

    Note: 'set_title_bar()' copies 78 characters out of that memory
    location, so if you only have 15 characters, it will get the next
    63 bytes anyway.  That could result in random binary gibberish in
    the title bar, so be sure you fill in all 78 characters of the
    string you want in the title.
